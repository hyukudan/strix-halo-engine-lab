//   router      strix/minimax_moe.hpp route_row (FP32 logits, lane l chains j = l, l + 32, ...; butterfly; sigmoid +

//   experts     strix_gemv (strix-trellis 0.3, the decode GEMV; not strix_gemm, which takes WMMA) for gate (w1) and up (w3) [6144 -> 1536 rank slice, K3], swiglu
//               (min(g, 7) sigmoid(1.702 min(g, 7)) (clamp(u, +-7) + 1)), strix_gemv down (w2) [1536 -> 6144];
//   combine     acc = 0; acc = fmaf(w_e, y_e, acc) over the row's 4 experts in ascending expert id; acc + shared;
//   shared      the same MLP with the shared expert (K5), added unscaled;
//   linears     strix_gemv (input transform, split GEMV core, output transform) for the dense sites.
// Every row's bits depend only on that row (batch invariance N = 1..8): the per-row chains, split boundaries and
// reduction orders never depend on the other rows of the call.
//
// Launch structure of one MoE layer (enqueue_moe, defaults; no host synchronisation):
//   1. router + shared expert gate/up in one launch (128 router CTAs, the last one does top-4 + dispatch table;
//      the other CTAs stream the shared expert's gate/up meanwhile)          STRIX_MMX_MOE_OVERLAP=0 disables;
//   2. routed gate/up: the library GEMV grid (CTA = 4 tile columns x 1 split) over all active slots, split input
//      transform in LDS, raw split partials; the last CTA per block does H, svh, SwiGLU and the down transform;
//   3. down, same grid; the last CTA per output block does H, svh and the fixed-order combine (+ shared).
// Eight-row v4 gate/up tiles interleave gate and up with or without overlap; STRIX_MMX_MOE_GU_INTERLEAVE=0 restores the former z planes
// for diagnosis (same CTA count, partials and counters). It is read per call, as is STRIX_MMX_MOE_SINGLE.
// The engine resolver supplies 1 for both switches; raw-library unset is 0 for both.
// STRIX_MMX_MOE_SINGLE=1 enables the coalesced singleton reader: device dispatch selects it
// only at N=8, U>=25, S>=18, nrows=1, K3, narrow W=4, Depth=4. Other slots use the existing reader in the same launch.
// STRIX_MMX_MOE_DOWN_SPLIT (read per call; resolver default 1, raw-library unset 0) makes v4 down partial-only and runs
// one stream-ordered finish/combine launch (48 CTAs), removing (U+1)*8 narrow / (U+1)*4 wide arrivals per output tile.
// 1 = only the measured winning regime (route::moe_down_split: N=4, wide, W=4, Depth=4), 2 = every v4 down (diagnostic,
// the B8 remeasure), 0 = off. It reuses the same scratch and ordered finish; only the combine launch publishes.
// Without the split, both reader settings keep three overlap launches; N<8, Depth=8/12 and wide/W=8 use the same
// kernels at SINGLE=0/1.
// Contract: 16 gate/up splits, 4 down splits, ascending k tiles, both fdot2 chains, reduce4
// offsets 2 then 1, ascending split sum, H128/scales, SwiGLU rounding, ascending-expert fmaf, then shared add.
// The fused residual remains h+(p0+p1). Native/model/complete-workload qualification is still required.
// Flags (all paths bitwise): STRIX_MMX_MOE_WIDE unset = wide at N2-4 only (measurement), 1 = wide at every N (expert
// gate/up/down: CTA = 16 columns, wave = 4 columns
// streaming 16-byte k-row runs; 0 = 4-column CTAs), STRIX_MMX_MOE_V 4 (1/3 older forms), STRIX_MMX_MOE_DEPTH3 4 (8/12),
// STRIX_MMX_MOE_W 4 (8), STRIX_MMX_MOE_DEPTH8R 0 (2), STRIX_MMX_ROUTER 2 (1 = 16-CTA form; used when the
// post-exchange is fused, h != nullptr), STRIX_MMX_LINEAR_V unset = a measured per-site / row-count schedule of
// v4 / v8 / v9 (mmx_moe.hip scheduled_linear_version; 1, 3..9 force one form). Not for the head: the library's strix_gemv
// is faster there (it already runs at ~230 of the ~247 GB/s read ceiling).
