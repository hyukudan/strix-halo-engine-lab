# Source and provenance ledger

Status: P0 partially resolved. A reference becomes a canonical source for this
engine only when it is pinned here with an immutable revision, its applicable
license and a verifiable contract.

| Component | Pinned candidate source | Verified license | Independent contract | Status |

## Approval rule

The experimental selected dense projection adapts wave-transform and ordered
split-reduction organization from the related project-owned `strix_trellis`
tree at `9c28680b46e379abe0ad92a14c4a7611fd7bfd74`, specifically
`src/transforms.hpp` and `src/backend.hpp`. That pinned tree contains no
license or notice file; do not infer an upstream license or independent
authorship for the adapted organization. Distribution terms remain unresolved.
The new FP32 transform/FMA recipe, asset pins and qualification boundary are
documented in [the dense projection contract](../research/dense-trellis-g1.md).
The source model's existing provenance and asset terms continue to apply.

Each row needs a URL/repo, a SHA or immutable revision, the applicable license,
artifact hashes and a verifiable contract. Secondary references, such as
open, non-canonical pull requests, may guide tests and structural checks, but
none of them is the sole oracle for an implementation.
