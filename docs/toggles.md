# Toggles

[Español](toggles.es.md)

This page lists the user-visible switches: CLI flags, `STRIX_*` environment variables and CMake options.
It says what each one does, what the default is, and when other hardware would want a different value.
It does not repeat measured gains. Gains, preconditions and receipts live in
[optimizations.md](optimizations.md) and the machine-readable [optimizations.json](optimizations.json).
Per-model numbers live in [performance.md](performance.md) and [measured-gains.md](measured-gains.md).

The defaults are tuned for one target: gfx1151 (Ryzen AI Max+ 395) with 128 GB of unified memory,
and a pair of these over USB4. On that target the plain command already runs the measured production path.
You only need this page to inspect a path, to debug, or to move the engine to different hardware.

## Rules that apply to every toggle

- An argument on the command line wins over a default. A variable already set in the environment is never changed.
- `--print-effective-config` prints the resolved environment and arguments before any device work.
- `=0` (or the listed `--no-*` flag) turns a default-on item off.
- A missing precondition (pack, library, memory) drops its item and prints one line on stderr.
- Pair apps need the same value on both ranks.

## Profiles: exact vs FAST

| Profile | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--profile default` | Current production path; exports no profile overrides. This is the default. |
| `--profile fast` | Adds only qualified bit-changing options. Rows that are not qualified yet stay off (see `--allow-pending`). |
| `--profile quality` | A higher-precision pack where one exists (Nemotron EXL3). Otherwise equal to `default`. |

Named profiles exist for Qwen, the DeepSeek pair, Gemma4/Nemotron and `strix-glm5-rank`.
MiniMax has no named product profile: `--profile NAME:PROMPT.u32:STEPS` runs a timed session.
GLM rank accepts `--profile default|fast|quality` (also `--profile=NAME`); its bare `--profile` still enables kernel timing
and can be combined with a named profile. GLM `fast` sets only `STRIX_GLM_PF_WMMA=1`; an explicit environment
value wins, and `--baseline` / `STRIX_GLM_BASELINE=1` vetoes the profile addition. `quality` uses default settings
with a notice. Both ranks must agree on the effective WMMA setting; existing startup guards still apply.

See the [Qwen profiles](optimizations.md#qwen-product-profiles),
[DeepSeek pair profiles](optimizations.md#product-profiles-pair) and [GLM FAST row](optimizations.md#glm-pf-wmma-x).
FAST changes the numerics. Use it when throughput matters more than bit-identical output.

| Switch | Engine | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `STRIX_QPF2K_MOE_ROUTE_BF16=1`, `--prefill-moe-route-bf16` | qwen | off (on in `fast`) | BF16 MoE routing in prefill. |
| `STRIX_QPF2K_GDN_FP16_CHUNK=1`, `--gdn-fp16-chunk` | qwen | off (on in `fast`) | FP16 GDN chunk in prefill. |
| `--prefill-exact-fp16` | qwen | off | Forces the exact FP16 prefill path. |
| `STRIX_DS41_FAST_MOE=1` | deepseek | off (`fast`) | Relaxed MoE epilogue. |
| `STRIX_DS41_FAST_PREFILL=1` | deepseek | off | Profile `ds41-fast-pf-v1` (one resolver, `include/strix/ds41_fast_profile.hpp`): `STRIX_DS41_FAST_ATTN=2` + `STRIX_DS41_FAST_MOE=1` + `STRIX_DS41_FAST_DENSE=1`; a lever variable that is set wins. Changes logits. Pair gate against exact (1,280 teacher-forced rows, 20 prompts, both ranks equal): pooled KL 0.0090, top-1 97.9 %, dNLL +0.0112: KL and top-1 pass, **dNLL fails the 0.01 limit**; a one-ulp null arm scores KL 0.0097 / 98.3 % / +0.0170 on the same gate, so the profile is at the engine's perturbation floor and stays unqualified. Warm pair prefill 8K 1,169 -> 1,381 tok/s, 11.6K 1,206 -> 1,439 tok/s. |
| `STRIX_DS41_FAST_ATTN=2` | deepseek | off | BF16 one-pass sparse attention on the shared flash core (`ds41-attn-bf16flash-v1`; `1` = the older f16 WMMA form, slower than exact). Gate alone: KL 0.0100, top-1 97.5 %, dNLL +0.0131 (fails dNLL). |
| `STRIX_DS41_FAST_DENSE=1` | deepseek | off | Dense Q8_0 x A8 products (q_b, o_a, o_b; calls of at least `STRIX_DS41_FAST_DENSE_MIN_ROWS`, default 128) in one FP16 WMMA chain on the shared dense core, policy `dense-q8a8-f16-v1` (`src/core/f16_dense_q8a8.hpp`; `STRIX_F16_Q8A8_WAVES=8\|16` forces the CTA height, same bits). Gate alone (1,024 rows): KL 0.0099, top-1 98.1 %, dNLL +0.0144 (fails dNLL). |
| `STRIX_GLM_PF_WMMA=1` | glm | off (on in rank `--profile fast`) | WMMA prefill. Opt-in FAST identity; `=0` disables even in `fast`. |

## The regime rule

The engine picks a kernel family by the number of rows in flight, not by model.

- **Decode at one row** is bound by memory bandwidth. Each weight is read once per token.
  The engine uses the smallest weights it can read: trellis/EXL3 packs (`STRIX_DS41_TRELLIS`, the EXL3 packs of MiniMax, GLM and Nemotron `quality`).
- **Wide verify and batched decode** (MTP, DSpark, several slots) multiply rows per weight read.
  Past a row threshold the matrix-core and integer paths win. The thresholds are toggles:
  `STRIX_INTPREFILL_DENSE_ROWS` (qwen, 512), `STRIX_QPF2K_DENSE_MIN_ROWS` (qwen, 1024 or 512 by site),
  `STRIX_GLM_PF_WMMA_ROWS` (glm, 64), `STRIX_MM_PF_ASYNC_MIN_ROWS` (minimax, 2048),
  `STRIX_GLM_PF_EXACT_X_MIN_ROWS` (glm, 64; 32 with FAST WMMA).
- **Prefill** is bound by compute. It uses the integer and matrix-core paths, and the FAST profile adds the bit-changing ones.

The crossover depends on the ratio of compute to bandwidth. On gfx1151 that ratio is fixed, so the thresholds are fixed.
On other hardware, move them:

| Hardware differs by | Effect | What to try |
|---|---|---|
| More memory bandwidth (discrete GPU, HBM) | One-row decode is cheaper; small packs matter less | Higher-precision packs; disable trellis with `=0` and compare |
| More WMMA / INT4 throughput | Integer paths win at fewer rows | Lower the `*_MIN_ROWS` / `*_DENSE_ROWS` thresholds |
| Less WMMA / INT4 throughput | Integer paths win only at many rows | Raise the thresholds, or `=0` to keep the exact path |
| Less memory | KV, prefix cache and draft model compete with weights | Smaller prefix-cache budgets, `--slots`, `--prefill-rows N` |
| Faster or slower interconnect | Changes when overlap and splitting pay off | The pair transport switches below |

## CLI flags by area

The tables below list the curated flags. The full list of environment variables follows in the
[environment index](#environment-index).

### Memory and KV

| Flag | Engine | Default | What it does | When other hardware wants it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--residency register\|copy` | qwen | `register` | Registers weights in place instead of copying. Needs a high `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK`. | `copy` when pinned memory is limited or on a discrete GPU with its own VRAM. |
| `--serve-memory-budget-bytes` | qwen | auto | Caps serve memory. | Lower on boxes with less than 128 GB. |
| `--known-prefix-*` | qwen | auto | Budgets for the known-prefix cache. | Lower with less memory. |
| `--prefix-cache on\|off` | qwen-rtx | on | Prefix cache. | Off when VRAM is tight. |
| `--no-prefix-cache`, `--no-prefix-disk`, `--prefix-cache-mb`, `--prefix-cache-dir` | deepseek serve | on | Prefix cache in RAM and on disk. | Smaller `--prefix-cache-mb` with less memory; move `--prefix-cache-dir` to fast storage. |
| `--capacity`, `--slots` | minimax / deepseek serve | per model | Context per slot and number of slots. | Fewer slots or less capacity with less memory. |
| `--prefill-rows auto\|N` | deepseek serve | `auto` | Prefill piece size that fits both ranks after weights and drafter. | Set `N` when auto refuses, or to trade memory for prefill speed. |

### Prefill

| Flag | Engine | Default | What it does | When other hardware wants it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--block-schedule default\|tail-large` | qwen-rtx | `tail-large` | Order of blocks in the large kernels. | `default` on GPUs with a different CU count. |
| `--prefill auto` | glm | `auto` | Picks the prefill path. | - |
| `--prefill-chunk N` | glm | 512 | Prefill chunk size in rows. | Larger with more compute; smaller with less memory. |
| `--prefill-path device` | deepseek serve | `device` | Prefill on the GPU. | - |

### Decode, MTP and DSpark

| Flag | Engine | Default | What it does | When other hardware wants it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--mtp-bundle`, `--rope-yarn 2\|4 --context C` | qwen | - | MTP draft bundle; YaRN for long context. | - |
| `--mtp 0\|1` | glm | resolved (see `--print-effective-config`) | Turns the MTP draft off or on. | `0` when memory is short. |
| `--identity r1b\|r1` | glm | `r1b` | Decode identity. | `r1` to compare. |
| `--dspark`, `--no-dspark`, `--dspark-vocab auto\|full` | deepseek | on when the draft is found | DSpark speculative draft. | `--no-dspark` when memory is short. |
| `--dspark-ranks` | deepseek | 2 | Ranks that run the draft. | - |
| `--dspark-max-inflight` | deepseek | 4 | Requests in flight before the draft turns off. `0` = always draft. | Higher with more compute per row. |
| `--dspark-mode off\|auto\|on`, `--dspark-prior` | minimax | `auto` (`STRIX_MM_SERVE_DSPARK`) | DSpark draft. | `off` when the draft does not fit. |

### Pair transport

| Flag | Engine | Default | What it does | When other hardware wants it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--transport usb4auto\|usb4gpu` (prefill: `usb4-auto`\|`usb4-gpu`) | deepseek pair | `usb4auto` | USB4 transport. `usb4gpu` uses GPU-direct streams when the driver offers them, else the host path. | Other interconnects need their own transport. |
| `--peer-timeout` | deepseek serve | 120 | Seconds to wait for the peer. | Higher on slow links. |
| `--transport usb4gpu\|usb4auto\|usb4-auto\|tcp`, `STRIX_QWEN_PF_PIPE_TRANSPORT` | qwen pair prefill | `usb4gpu` | Large seam payloads use the production communicator size router; control/CRC/ACK stays host. `usb4auto` or `usb4-auto` forces host-only. Both ranks must agree. Native bitwise/TTFT gates pending. | [Routing evidence](coord/transport-routing.md). |
| `--transport usb4gpu\|usb4-auto` | minimax serve | `usb4gpu` | Routed GPU-direct for large communicator messages, host for ≤64 KiB; host-only fallback when unavailable. Keep XFER decode; PFX stays rank-only. `usb4-auto` forces host and retains the qualified session-cache route. | [Regimes and qualification limits](coord/transport-routing.md). |
| `--tp-attention`, `--no-tp-attention` | deepseek | on | Splits attention across the two ranks. | Off when the link is slow relative to compute. |
| `--engram-direct`, `--engram-mapped` | deepseek | `direct` | Engram table access. | `mapped` when memory is short. |
| `--decode-xch xfer\|comm`, `STRIX_GLM_DECODE_XCH` | glm | `xfer` (`comm` in baseline) | Decode exchange mode. | Compare both on a different interconnect. |
| `--wb-defer`, `--wb-stream`, `--ce-pacing` (`--no-*`) | deepseek-rtx | on | Write-back and copy-engine pacing. Also `STRIX_DS41_WB_STREAM`, `STRIX_DS41_CE_PACING`. | Off on links where the copy engine is not the bottleneck. |
| `STRIX_DS41_OB_SPLIT=K` | deepseek | off | Splits the o_b exchange into K chunks that overlap compute. Exact. Slower on the host path. | Try on a faster interconnect or with GPU-direct. |

Pair setup: [pair-setup.md](pair-setup.md).

### Exact vs FAST

| Flag | Engine | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--profile default\|fast\|quality` | qwen, deepseek pair, gemma4/nemotron, glm rank | `default` | See [Profiles](#profiles-exact-vs-fast). |
| `--profile` (bare) | glm rank | off | Kernel timing; preserved alongside named profiles. |
| `--profile NAME:PROMPT.u32:STEPS` | minimax rank | off | Timed session, not a product profile. |
| `--allow-pending` | pair apps | off | Lets `fast` apply rows that are not qualified yet. |
| `--print-effective-config` | all | off | Prints the resolved configuration and exits before device work. |
| `STRIX_DS41_BASELINE=1` | deepseek | off | Turns off every production default. Runs the plain command as it ran before. |

### Shared core and INT4 (opt-in)

All of these are off by default. With them off, every engine runs the same kernels and launches as before
the shared tiled core (`src/core`) landed, with the same bits.

| Switch | Engine | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `STRIX_DS41_PF_CORE=0\|moe\|dense\|1` | deepseek | per form | Which prefill products run on the shared tiled core instead of the DeepSeek kernels: `moe` = expert gate/up and down, `dense` = the dense Q8_0 x A8 products, `1` = both, `0` = none. Same bits either way. Unset: the shared core where the rank fixture measures it faster, the Q8_0 gate/up (-0.6..-2.2 %) and down (-6.0..-7.2 %) of the shared expert (-2.8..-3.9 % for both), and only in 16-row batches with `STRIX_DS41_FAST_MOE` off and `STRIX_DS41_PREFILL_STAGE` not `1`, and the routed IQ2_XXS gate/up for hidden widths that are a multiple of 1024 (-7.1..-8.2 % at 2048 / 4096 / 8192 rows; other widths keep the DeepSeek kernels) and Q2_K down (-2.4..-3.4 %), which run there without the LDS weight tile so that two workgroups share a WGP; the dense products stay on the DeepSeek kernels. Resolved once per run; any other value, the empty one included, is rejected. |
| `STRIX_DS41_FAST_I4=1` | deepseek | off | Draft lossy prefill: GGUF expert weights decoded in the kernel to INT4, A8 input requantized to A4. Runs on the shared core. `STRIX_DS41_FAST_I4_SCOPE=all\|gu` picks gate/up/down (default) or gate/up only. Not quality-qualified. |
| `STRIX_GLM_MODEL_FORMAT=fast_i4` | glm | `exl3` | Lossy format: the routed gate/up experts of the late MoE layers are stored as INT4 (W4A4 prefill, W4A16 decode), their EXL3 copy is released. Refuses the exact identities. Against FAST on the pair: prefill logits KL 0.0145, top-1 95.4 %, NLL -0.002 (gate 0.02 / 93 % / +0.01); teacher-forced decode tokens KL 0.0098, top-1 94.8 %; prefill 8K -2.0 %, 32K -3.2 %; plain and MTP decode speed unchanged. |
| `STRIX_GLM_FAST_I4_EXL3_LAYERS=<list>` | glm | `0-14` | With `fast_i4`: MoE layers (ordinals, ranges `a-b`, or `none`) that keep the EXL3 routed experts. An early INT4 layer costs a saturating quality step, late layers are cheap; INT4 on every layer does not pass the quality gate. |
| `STRIX_GLM_FAST_I4_SCOPE=gate_up\|all` | glm | `gate_up` | With `fast_i4`: which routed matrices are INT4. `all` adds the down projection (8K warm prefill -3.6 % against FAST; thinner quality margin). |
| `STRIX_GLM_FAST_I4_SCALE=fast_full\|legacy` | glm | `fast_full` | With `fast_i4`: weight scale rule of the load-time conversion. `fast_full` uses the full nibble range [-8, 7] at 0.9 of the non-clipping scale (weight error 0.0095 against 0.0115 for `legacy`, same conversion time). |
| `STRIX_GLM_FAST_I4_PAIRED=0` | glm | on | With `fast_i4` and scope `gate_up`: turns off the paired gate/up kernel (one kernel reads the gate and up INT4 weights and its SwiGLU epilogue writes the down input) and runs the separate gate, up and activation calls. Same output bits either way. |
| `STRIX_GLM_I4_CHAIN_GSAVE=1` | glm | off | With `fast_i4`, scope `all` and `STRIX_MOE_I4_CHAIN=1`: the paired gate/up GEMM keeps its first-pass gate values in the call's gate/up rows instead of registers, so gate/up and down share one tile plan and one tile list. Same output bits. Off by default: on this model's shapes the register form (gate/up on 64-row tiles, down on 128-row tiles) measured 3-7 % faster per call. `STRIX_MOE_I4_CHAIN_GSAVE=0` forces the register form in every engine. |
| `STRIX_GLM_PF_SCORE_SEQ=1`, `STRIX_GLM_PF_SCORE_BLOCK=<1..8>` | glm | off, `1` | Quality harness (`STRIX_GLM_PF_SCORE_LAST`): one score file per prefill call, and rows per head call. Measurement only. |
| `STRIX_GLM_PF_STREAMS=1` | glm | off | Single compute stream for the seqpar TP2 prefill schedule. Same bits; not faster in the first samples. |
| `STRIX_MMX_MODEL_FORMAT=fast_i4` | minimax | `exl3` | Draft lossy prefill: each MoE layer is converted to INT4 during prefill in two reusable buffers (+3.6 GiB); decode stays on EXL3. See [MiniMax grouped prefill](minimax-grouped-prefill.md#draft-fast_i4). |
| `STRIX_DS41_PREFILL_LEASE=1`, `STRIX_DS41_ENGRAM_DEVICE_READY=1`, `STRIX_DS41_SEED_EARLY=1` | deepseek | off | Prefill structure options (lease-fenced exchange, per-layer Engram readiness, early draft seed). Same bits; no gain measured yet. |

### Debug only

These flags do not change the output. They add checks, traces or timing. Do not use them for benchmarks.

| Flag | Engine | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `--timing` | various | Per-stage timing. |
| `--verify-trace` | decode apps | Traces verify steps. |
| `--xb-check`, `--decode-check` | various | Compares against a reference path. |
| `--resume-check*` | serve | Checks state after resume. |
| `--selftest`, `--idcheck` | various | Self tests and identity checks. |

Environment variables whose names contain `TRACE`, `DUMP`, `DEBUG`, `LOG`, `PROBE`, `TIMING`, `CHECK` or `STATS` are debug only.
